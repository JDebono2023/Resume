As the primary full-stack Web Developer for the last three years, I have been responsible for the creation, maintenance, deployment, training and technical support for all development. I have lead the ground-up development of multiple custom client-facing web and mobile solutions, while working with a multi-faceted team to ensure that these projects are not only functional and responsive but also align with strategic business goals. These systems range from eCommerce integration with simple Vue.js based UX for web clients to full CMS build-outs leveraging the Laravel v.9 through V.11 platform and Livewire. A comprehensive understanding of SQL databases allows me to develop robust and scalable applications. I love to build and problem solve, and value all opportunities to learn and integrate development improvements, while delivering products I am proud of.
